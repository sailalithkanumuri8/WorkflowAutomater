,Brimblecombe Builders Pty Ltd,Brimblecombe Builders Pty Ltd,,,,,"Commercial Builders - Adelaide With its rich history of working as commercial construction builders and serving the industry through the Master Builders Association of South Australia, Brimblecombe Builders have proved their integrity and dedication to the industry many times. Here are further reasons for their success. The needs of the client and the project are considered right from the outset of Brimblecombe Builders Pty Ltd engagement. Many of the projects undertaken by Brimblecombe Builders have needed special consideration in respect of the clients needs. For example, * The need to maintain services to existing buildings, * Working in and around occupied premises, special hoardings and safety provisions, * Access restrictions, * Specific staging arrangements, * Noise and dust control, * Night work, * Security constraints etc to name a few. Whilst the above considerations are of the utmost importance, the overall project needs are not disregarded and quality requirements are not sacrificed. Safety of the general public, third parties, client, consultants, and on site tradesmen forms a major part in Brimblecombe Builders Pty Ltd company policy. Brimblecombe Builders Pty Ltd have developed a sound reputation for the successful completion of a diverse range of construction projects on time and within budget. The company maintains a professional approach when conducting its business and prides itself upon the quality that is attained in the end product. One of the keys to achieving the project requirements of quality, completion on time and within budget is the adoption of a cohesive amicable team approach. This aids the smooth running of the project and avoids disputation at all levels flowing down to trade contractors. Brimblecombe Builders employees are long standing company orientated individuals. A fine mix is maintained between tertiary expertise and practical experience. A Brief History - George Brimblecombe was privileged to have his father as a labourer when he first established the company in 1927. Farming the land was unrewarding and drove the family into a new era, to the good fortune of Adelaide. ""I promised my grandparents that I would keep the name and I wanted to keep the link to the tradition alive"", was Mike Rundell's heartfelt response to ""why the name Brimblecombe Builders Pty Ltd ?"" It means something in the commercial construction and building industry. Not too many companies can claim such a rich family heritage contributing to the Adelaide skyline and the industry in general. George was trained as a bricklayer, originally called an improver. This was based upon the idea to 'learn and make better'. Again this still remains as a guiding principal of the company '... make it better.' Following the introduction of smart business value saw Brimblecombe set up a major crane hiring service, joinery fabrication workshop and engineering company in Adelaide South Australia.",brimblecombe.com.au,https://www.linkedin.com/company/brimblecombe-builders-pty-ltd,8,"11-50	",Private,Adelaide,GA,US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I will tell you this, if I accept a new client I will always be involved in whatever service we agree upon. You might wonder why someone with my experience would be involved with something, let's say, as routine as bookkeeping. Truthfully, I would pass on the everyday task of data entry, but I can promise you that I will begin the engagement with an analysis of your business, and your existing process. Once this has been completed, I will determine the best way to proceed. At this point, I will assign the data entry task to a team member, but I will always do the month end closing. Once this is completed I will sit down with you and go over your Profit & Loss and Balance Sheet. If not monthly, (this will be your choice), at least quarterly, (this will be my requirement).

All of Farmer’s books are inspired by his life growing up on a farm where farm-to-table was a lifestyle not just a popular notion. With a passion for the land and Southern culture, he earned a degree in gardening design and then opened a landscape design company in 2005. Farmer was soon asked to consult on an important historic garden that needed restoration and updating. News quickly spread about James’ work, and the garden was soon featured in The Atlanta Journal and Constitution, Southern Living Magazine, Traditional Home Magazine, and ultimately in the book, Private Gardens of Georgia. James’ business soared in the Southeast as a result. At the same time, because of his love for entertaining from the garden, he began creating floral arrangements and consulting on food for private parties and weddings held by a growing client list. Local media coverage of these very special events, and word- of-mouth have made a “James Farmer Party” in demand in the South.

This will make Kaya the largest winery resort North of Atlanta. Kaya’s Winery and Tasting Room are built atop a ridge that is sixteen-hundred feet above elevation and offers the most exquisite panoramic mountain view in North Georgia. The Tasting Room features twelve foot windows, Edison light bulbs, and reclaimed wood, making the combination of Kaya and the Appalachian Mountains a retreat. Enjoy the cool summer breeze on our two-thousand square-foot covered deck with live music and most importantly some wine. All Kaya wines are made exclusively from estate grown grapes produced from our property. The Werkheiser family believes that wine is made in the vineyard and represents specific growing styles. Our vineyards are planted with classic European, Italian and American varietals. All of our grapes are hand harvested and gently processed in our facility, we call this the art of wine. Our techniques are meticulous; the secret lies in the management of the vineyard. Our Wine Maker, Ariel, shines when turning wonderful fruit into wine. After harvest the wine is taken to our climate controlled Barrel Room where it is given the perfect environment for integration of flavor and aroma between wood and fruit. Our Kaya Team loves to produce hand-crafted complex wines that cater to the serious enthusiast. Our tasting room goal is to provide an educational experience for those with a passion to learn about wine.

The problem is that when you focus on great care it causes you to look at people as objects…in need of care. We really believe that bar is way too low. We have built a community where older adults can come build worthwhile, meaningful relationships with our team and new friends. We have found that great care is always the by-product of a meaningful relationship. At Savannah Commons, we offer 3 levels of care under one roof: Independent Living, Assisted Living, and secured Memory care. Independent Living: for our residents who are loving the later years of life and looking to right-size and find a close knit community of friends. It’s a wonderful mix of daily social events and peaceful retreat to your own suite. Envision a cruise ship on land. Assisted Living: ideal for residents who value their independence, but may need assistance with daily activities. Our community team members are raving fans of encouraging independence with assistance readily accessible at all times of day. Memory Care: for our residents who are living with some form of cognitive disability. Every member of our team is NIDE (National Institute for Dementia Education) certified. That includes everyone from the chefs and housekeepers to the concierge and nurses. This allows us to interact with our residents as unique individuals rather than objects in need of care. Whether you want to right-size your home or are looking to be surrounded by your new closest friends, our community boasts the best there is to offer with a touch of southern-hospitality. And around here, there is no shortage of local attractions. Savannah Commons is located in Savannah GA, one of the most unique & historic cities in the country.

,OccuFit,OccuFit,,,,,"Since 1995, Occupational Fitness (OccuFit) provides assistance with hearing conservation, respirator fit testing, and drug screen administration. OSHA mandates that employers must provide hearing conservation programs to employees exposed to 85 decibels or more over an 8 hour time weighted average. To protect employees, work areas should be tested to determine if the threshold has been reached. OccuFit provides sound testing for employers to determine if a hearing conservation program is necessary. OccuFit's CAOHC certified technicians are trained to provide courteous service to our client's employees, and also be efficient at minimizing time away from production. OccuFit's mobile units come to clients' facilities to provide audiology tests, averaging about 15 minutes per test. Occufit's units have varying capacities, but the largest unit can test 8 individuals every 15 minutes. OccuFit's mobile units contain individual testing booths to insure the highest quality test, minimizing the risk of invalid tests. Each employee receives a printout of the results immediately after the test. Hearing conservation training can also be provided to employees by OccuFit. OccuFit goes beyond testing to ensure that the client receives only valid workplace-related recordable hearing loss. Our post-testing process involves consulting and extensive review of possible recordable hearing loss to determine if the employee's hearing loss is workplace-related. Not all mobile testing companies do this. OccuFit's management values long-term relationship with its clients and with occupational nurses and health and safety managers. Please contact OccuFit to learn more about the company's services. 706.937.8787.",occufit.com,https://www.linkedin.com/company/occupational-fitness-ltd,19,"11-50	",Private,Ringgold,GA,US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The equipment used by SDP is the most advanced in the industry and utilizes certified calibrated torque meters to affirm that the load-bearing capacity of every pier we install meets or exceeds the engineered prescription. Additionally, all products used by SDP are manufactured in Centralia, Missouri using USA-produced steel and include a manufacturers lifetime guarantee. Devens degree in civil engineering allows him a deeper understanding of structural capacities coupled with respect for the importance of following engineered specifications when reinforcing any foundation. Because of this informed approach, in a very short time Southern Design Piers has gained the trust of customers by delivering value propositions not offered by the competition. Whether your job requires a simple single helix design or the most complicated helical configuration, Southern Design Piers has the resources, education, and training to measurably comply with engineered standards, propose cost-saving alternative helical configurations to meet load-bearing capacity more efficiently, and document the outcomes. No two job sites are the same. Why should the customer settle for a one size fits all approach when SDP has the know-how to perform more efficiently and cost-effectively?",https://sodesignco.com,https://www.linkedin.com/company/southern-design-piers,22,"1-10	",Venture Capital,Cumming,GA,US,,"Ironwood Capital Advisors, LLC, High Street Capital, LLC",,Founder,Blanchard,Benson,blanchard@sodesignco.com,https://www.linkedin.com/in/blanchard-benson-339989224,,,,,,

Staffed entirely by second- and third-year law students, the Law Review is the school’s only general subject-matter publication. The journal publishes one volume annually, in four quarterly issues. The journal also hosts an annual Symposium and publishes an issue dedicated to an important, developing area of the law. Dedicated to publishing quality and timely legal scholarship for over fifty years, the Georgia Law Review publishes the work of renowned law professors, judges, and legal practitioners in addition to selected notes written by student members. The mission of the Georgia Law Review addresses two principal goals. First, the journal provides superb legal education and training. The Georgia Law Review editors select, edit, and publish the works that appear within the pages of its volumes. Through this process, the Georgia Law Review editors develop and hone their research, writing, editorial, and leadership skills. More importantly, however, the Georgia Law Review provides a forum for legal reform. In its inaugural issue, Dean Lindsey Cowen articulated the purpose of the journal: ""seeking out the weak points in our law, developing appropriate recommendations for change, and advocating them persuasively in its pages.” The editors of the Georgia Law Review continually strive to fulfill this mission and to preserve the publication as a platform for legal reform.",georgialawreview.org,https://www.linkedin.com/company/georgia-law-review,28,"51-200	",Private,Athens,GA,US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,WLTZ NBC 38 and The CW GA-BAMA,WLTZ NBC 38 and The CW GA-BAMA,,,,,"History The station began broadcasting on October 29, 1970, as WYEA and aired an analog signal on UHF channel 38. It was branded on-air as ""YAY-TV"" and featured promotions showing a cheerleader with pompoms. WYEA was originally owned by Huntsville, Alabama broadcaster Charles Grisham and his company, Gala Broadcasting. It brought a full NBC affiliate to Columbus after a full decade in which NBC was mostly limited to off-hours clearances on CBS outlet WRBL and ABC affiliate WTVM. Later in the 1970s, WYEA became the flagship station of Aflac's broadcast operations (a locally based insurance company). The outlet added the -TV suffix to its call sign on January 23, 1979. In 1981, Aflac sold the station to J. Curtis Lewis, owner of WJCL-TV-FM in Savannah, Georgia, WLTX and WNOK-FM in Columbia, South Carolina, and WSTZ-FM-AM in Jackson, Mississippi. On August 31 of that year, the station changed its calls to the current WLTZ and adopted the branding ""Z 38"". Lewis kept WLTZ until 2007--long after selling off his other stations--when SagamoreHill Broadcasting purchased the station. WLTZ joined The CW network on April 27, 2009, adding it to a second digital channel, 38.2. In April 2015, WLTZ gave birth to a new company within the organization with the launch of Aligator Digital, a digital advertising agency. February 2017 brought Antenna TV's premiere on the third digital channel, 38.3, with the addition of MyNetworkTV programming during weeknights.",wltz.com,https://www.linkedin.com/company/wltz-nbc-38-and-the-cw-ga-bama,32,"11-50	",Private,Columbus,GA,US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While founded as a new company, Carlisle Construction is a continuation of the long-standing traditions and craftsmanship of the Carlisle family which has been in the construction industry for decades. Chance Carlisle founded the company on the principles of quality workmanship, customer service, and the strength of local community. The first years of Carlisle were focused on slow, steady growth, in areas where the history of craftsmanship could shine. Carlisle found a niche repairing and replacing historic doors and windows in installations on Fort Benning, the Eagle & Phenix mill, Johnson Mills, Thorpe Building, and other turn-of-the-20th-century buildings. In many cases, these items had to be custom fabricated to meet the aesthetic requirements of working on a historic building, while at the same time upgrading the flashing, waterproofing, and using modern materials and glazing in order to provide a modern quality of construction. Attention to detail and craftsmanship was the key to success. As Carlisle grew, Christopher ""Chase"" Carlisle joined his brother in 2004 and brought extensive light commercial construction and sales experience. Carlisle began to pursue more work with customers such as Spectrum Stores (later Circle K), Columbus State University, and the federal government. Over the next ten years, Carlisle Construction worked to expand its portfolio, capabilities, and customer base, and successfully weathered the 2008-2014 recession. Beginning in 2015, Carlisle Construction began to expand its operations and entered a growth phase, servicing customers such as Georgia DNR, Auburn University, Pratt & Whitney, Exide Technologies, and Synovus, among others.

Booking a corporate or team building event could not be easier; and with the amount of attractions we have to offer there's no need to look any further! Not only do we book all types and sizes of parties, but we are the party. After 10 pm on Friday and Saturday nights it's adults only and our bar is in full swing until 2 am. Still not convinced? Just one second inside the front entrance and you'll see why Rigby's is more than just a destination- it's an experience. The inexhaustible amount of games in the Arcade can keep any person busy for hours on end to see their initials to the top of the high score list. Our Laser-Tag stands tall at two stories with each team having their own ramp to the top. Speaking of the top, who doesn't love the bragging rights that come with being the top racer on our Go-Kart track, which is not an easy feat in our 35 mph electric karts. Not so much into the participating aspect of racing? That's cool. Take a seat at our Outdoor Bar that's parallel to the track, and a perfect spot for a first-hand viewing party of all that goes down on the turns with a cold one in hand. Once you've witnessed a few drifts, take a shot at our Mini Golf course. Master your trick shots and putts to come out under par on our 18 hole green. Don't miss out on our dynamite hole 19! For those of you that don't find the outdoors as appealing, thankfully the Full-Service Restaurant to your immediate right of the entrance indoors quenches thirst as well as suppresses your appetite. Take advantage of the seating around the building to make as home base- whether that be at one of our 10 Bowling Lanes complemented by the personal sofas and tables, alongside the Roller Skating floor on one of our rink-side stools, or in our 18+ billiards room.

,Athens Banner-Herald,Athens Banner-Herald,,,,,"• The Athens Banner-Herald's roots go back to the Athens Banner, first published on March 20, 1832, by Albon Chase and John Nisbet. In 1921, the Banner merged with the afternoon Herald, and was operated by Publisher Earl B. Braswell for the next 44 years. • In 1965, The Advertiser -- an Athens weekly published by local businessman Claude Williams -- was being converted to a daily newspaper to challenge the Banner-Herald. The owners knew that the Banner-Herald would be up for sale soon (because of a stipulation in the owner's will). On June 17, 1965, the first edition of the Athens Daily News rolled off the press. • Just 32 days later, William and Charles Morris, who owned newspapers in Augusta and Savannah, purchased the Banner-Herald, and they immediately made an offer to also purchase the Daily News, but were rebuffed, and a newspaper battle emerged between the morning Daily News and afternoon Banner-Herald. • But within a couple of years, the financial burden being carried by the owners of the Daily News forced them to sell the Daily News to the Morrises. The transaction was announced on Christmas Eve 1967. The papers continued to compete editorially, but eventually the staffs merged to provide content for both papers. • Athens Magazine, a bi-monthly full-color magazine featuring the people and places in Northeast Georgia, was started in spring 1989. • In June 1996, the papers started a Web site, originally called Athenaeum, which was changed to Online Athens in 1997. The site takes more than 5 million page views each month. • In May 2001, the afternoon Banner-Herald and morning Daily News were merged into one morning paper published under the Banner-Herald name. The paper is owned by Morris Communications Corp. of Augusta. Morris owns daily and non-daily newspapers along with several radio stations, magazines, an outdoor advertising company and several other media properties, stretching across the nation and into Europe.",onlineathens.com,https://www.linkedin.com/company/athens-banner-herald,53,"51-200	",Private,Athens,GA,US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
